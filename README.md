# Glimmering Potions

![](resources/banner.png)

Glimmering Potions adds in a few new unique drinks based on Terraria's potions. Each potion has a unique effect and can be found in any dungeon chest.

Recipes or methods of creating them may be provided in the future. The mod may also branch into separate potion utilities depending on demand (potion pouch, upgrading vanilla potions, etc).

Available potions include:
 - Bulwark Potion
 - False Heroism Potion
 - Restoration Potions
 - Surfacing Potion
 - Recall Potion
 - Teleportation Potion
 
and more are to come!
